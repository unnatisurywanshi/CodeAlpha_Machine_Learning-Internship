ðŸŽ¯ Key Responsibilities
Developed and optimized machine learning models for real-world datasets.
Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
Deployed models using frameworks such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.
Collaborated with mentors to analyze model performance and suggest improvements.
Utilized Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub for code versioning and documentation.
ðŸ”¬ Projects
1. Project Title 1: [Credit Score Model]
The project focuses on predicting an individualâ€™s credit score category (Good, Average, or Bad) based on financial and demographic features. The aim is to assist financial institutions in identifying the creditworthiness of potential customers. The dataset includes attributes like income, loan amount, payment history, and defaults.

Technologies:

Programming: Python
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
Outcome:

Achieved an accuracy of 85% using the Random Forest Classifier.
2. Project Title 2: [Handwritten Character Recognition]

This project involves building a deep learning model to recognize and classify handwritten characters from the English alphabet. The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient recognition system that can process handwritten input and predict the correct character. The model leverages computer vision techniques and deep learning frameworks.

Technologies:

Programming: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
Tools: Jupyter Notebook
Dataset: MNIST-like or custom dataset for handwritten English alphabets
Workflow:

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset and converted images to grayscale.
Resized and normalized images for better model training.
Augmented data to improve model generalization.
Model Development:

Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras.
Optimized the model architecture with multiple convolution, pooling, and dense layers.
Training and Evaluation:

Trained the model on the preprocessed dataset using the Adam optimizer.
Evaluated performance using accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix.
Testing and Results:

Tested the model on unseen handwritten samples.
Outcome:

Achieved an accuracy of 92% on the validation dataset.
